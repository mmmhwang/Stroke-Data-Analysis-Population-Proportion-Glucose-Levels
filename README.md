# Stroke-Data-Analysis-Population-Proportion-Glucose-Levels
In the dynamic healthcare landscape, addressing the global impact of strokes is crucial. Leveraging the "Stroke Prediction Dataset," our research delves into the complexities of stroke risk, utilizing diverse variables like gender, age, medical history, and lifestyle. With a focus on more than just binary prediction, we aim to identify subtle risk nuances, high-risk groups, and contribute to personalized medicine. By navigating this dataset, we seek to bridge the gap between raw data and clinical relevance, enhancing our understanding of stroke and average glucose level estimation.

The dataset is collected online from Kaggle. Kaggle serves as an online platform for data science competitions and a community for data scientists and machine learning professionals, operating under the umbrella of Google LLC. It is an open data source website. The “Stroke Prediction Dataset” has 5110 observations and 12 attributes, and was last updated in the year of 2021.

While for the purpose of this project, we have treated the entire dataset as the population of interest, we expect the results of our analysis to provide useful insights for the global population regarding stroke awareness and prevention. This generalization is based on the fact that no geographical/population information is provided for the dataset’s source, hence our conclusions will not address specific regions and/or subpopulations.

In this project, we will employ two different techniques. Simple Random Sampling (SRS) and Stratified Random Sampling.
